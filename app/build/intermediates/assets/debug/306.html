                <h3>How is Australia governed?</h3>
                <h4>Australian Government </h4>
                <p>The Australian Government is also called the Federal Government or the Commonwealth Government.</p>
                <ul>The Australian Parliament has two Houses:
                    <li>the House of Representatives</li>
                    <li>the Senate.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The members of both Houses are directly elected by the Australian people at federal elections. When you vote in a federal election, you usually elect representatives to each House. </p>

                <h4>The House of Representatives</h4>
                <p>The House of Representatives is sometimes called the Lower House or the People’s House. </p>
                <p>Australia is divided into federal electorates. Australians in each electorate vote for one person to represent them in the House of Representatives. This representative is called a Member of Parliament (MP).</p>
                <p>The number of MPs for each state and territory is based on the size of its population. The people of Australia elect a total of 150 members to the House of Representatives. </p>
                <p>The important work of the House of Representatives is to consider, debate and vote on proposals for new laws or changes to the laws. Members of the House of Representatives also discuss matters of national importance. </p>

                <h4>The Senate </h4>
                <p>The Senate is sometimes called the Upper House, the House of Review or the States’ House. </p>
                <p>The states are equally represented in the Senate,
regardless of their population size. There are 12 representatives elected from each state. Both mainland territories elect two representatives each. There are 76 representatives elected in total and they are called Senators. </p>
                <p>Senators also consider, debate and vote on new laws or changes to the laws. Senators also discuss matters of national importance. </p>
                <hr>
                
                <h4>State and territory government</h4>
                <p>There are six states and two mainland territories in Australia. Each state has its own constitution and its own parliament. State and territory governments are based in their capital cities. </p>
                <p>The leader of a state government is the Premier and the leader of a territory government is the Chief Minister. </p>
                <p>State governments operate in a similar way to the Australian Government. In each state, a Governor represents the Queen of Australia. In the Northern Territory, an Administrator is appointed by the Governor-General. The role and responsibilities of the Administrator are similar to those of a state Governor. </p>
                <p>As with the Australian Government, people vote to elect a representative for their area. These representatives become a member of the state or territory parliament. </p>
                <hr>
                
                <h4>Local government</h4>
                <p>The states and the Northern Territory are divided into local government areas. These may be called cities, shires, towns or municipalities. Each area has its own local council. Councils are responsible for planning and delivering services to their local community. Citizens in each local government area vote to elect their local councillors. </p>
