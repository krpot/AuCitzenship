<h2 id="p0">Part3 &ndash; Government and the law in Australia</h2>

<h3>How are laws administered?</h3>
<h4>The courts</h4>
<p>The courts in Australia are responsible for interpreting
    and applying the law. They are independent of the
    government. The courts decide if a person has broken
    the law or not and decide the penalty. Every person
    has the right to be represented by a lawyer in court.
    Courts can only base their decision on the evidence
    before them</p>

<h4>Judges and magistrates</h4>
<p>The judge or magistrate is the highest authority in the
    court. Judges and magistrates are independent and no
    one can tell them what to decide. </p>
<p>Judges and magistrates are appointed by the
    government, but the government cannot take their
    jobs away if it disagrees with their decisions</p>

<h4>Juries</h4>
<p>A court will use a jury in some cases to decide if a
    person has broken the law. </p>
<p>A jury is a group of ordinary people randomly chosen
    from the general population. The judge explains the
    law to the jury. In a criminal trial, if the jury finds a
    person guilty, the judge decides the penalty. </p>
<p>Under the law, people in Australia are considered
    innocent until they are found guilty by a court. </p>

<h4>The police</h4>
<p>The police maintain peace and order in the community.
    It is their job to protect life and property. They are
    independent of the government. If the police believe
    that someone has broken the law, they can arrest
    them and bring them before a court of law. The police
    may give evidence in court, but the court decides if a
    person is guilty or not. </p>
<p>The states and the Northern Territory have their own
    police forces. They deal with crimes under state and
    territory laws. </p>
<p>Australia also has a national police force called the
    Australian Federal Police. The Australian Federal Police
    investigates crimes against federal laws, for example,
    drug trafficking, crimes against national security and
    crimes against the environment. The Australian Federal
    Police is also responsible for general police work in the
    Australian Capital Territory. </p>
<p>The police and the community have a good
    relationship in Australia. You can report crimes and
    seek assistance from your local police. </p>
<p>It is important for you to be familiar with the laws in
    Australia, because not knowing a law is no excuse for
    breaking it. </p>
<p>It is a serious crime to bribe a police officer. It is a crime
    to even offer a bribe to a police officer. </p>

<h4>Criminal offences in Australia</h4>
<p>Some of the most serious crimes include murder,
    assault, sexual assault, violence against people or
    property, armed robbery or theft, having sexual
    relations with children or young people who are aged
    below the legal age of consent, dangerous driving of
    a motor car, possession and use of illegal drugs and
    fraud. </p>
<p>As in other countries, violence towards another
    person is illegal in Australia and is a very serious crime.
    This includes violence within the home and within
    marriage, known as domestic or family violence.
    Domestic violence includes physical, sexual or
    psychological abuse or harm, forced sexual relations,
    forced isolation or economic deprivation. </p>
<p>Carrying weapons such as knives or guns is against the
    law in Australia. A person who wishes to own a gun,
    for example, for use on a farm, must first obtain a
    firearm licence from the police. </p>

<h4>Traffic offences </h4>
<p>Road and traffic rules are controlled by state and
    territory governments. People can be fined large
    amounts of money or even sent to prison for breaking
    traffic laws. To drive a car in Australia, you must have a
    local driver’s licence and the car must be registered. </p>
<p>Everybody travelling in a car must wear a seatbelt.
    Babies and young children must be in an approved car
    seat. Traffic laws relating to speeding and driving after
    drinking alcohol or taking drugs are very strict. It is also
    against the law to talk on a hand-held mobile phone
    while driving. </p>
