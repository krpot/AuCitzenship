                <h3>What role do political parties play in the way Australia is governed?</h3>
                <p>A political party is a group of people who share similar
                    ideas about how a country should be governed. They
                    work together to have the partyâ€™s ideas turned into
                    laws. The main political parties in Australia are the
                    Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia,
                    the Nationals and the Australian Greens. </p>
                <p>
                    Most members of parliament belong to political
                    parties. Some members of parliament do not belong
                    to any political party. They are called Independents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Australia, you are free to join a political party if
                    you choose.

                <h3>How is the Australian Government formed?</h3>
                <p>After an election, the political party or coalition of
                    parties with the majority of members in the House
                    of Representatives forms the Australian Government.
                    The leader of this party becomes the leader of the
                    Australian Government, the Prime Minister. </p>
                <p>The party or coalition of parties with the second largest
                    number of members in the House of Representatives is
                    known as the Opposition. Its leader is called the Leader
                    of the Opposition</p>
                <p>The Prime Minister chooses MPs or Senators to
                    become ministers. Ministers are responsible for
                    important areas of government (called portfolios),
                    such as employment, Indigenous affairs or the Treasury.
                    Ministers with the most senior portfolios make up the
                    Cabinet, which is the key decision making body of the
                    Australian Government. </p>

                <h3>How are laws made?</h3>
                <p>Citizens of Australia elect people to represent them
                    in the Australian Parliament.</p>
                <p>The Australian Parliament makes and changes laws
                    to benefit the nation.</p>

                 <div class="well">
                     A member of the Australian Parliament proposes
                     a new law or a change to the law. This proposal
                     is called a Bill.
                 </div>
                 <div class="well">
                     The House of Representatives and the Senate
                     consider, debate and vote on whether they agree
                     with the Bill.
                 </div>
                 <div class="well">
                     If the majority of members in each House of
                     Parliament agrees to the Bill, it goes to the
                     Governor-General.
                 </div>
                <div class="well">
                    When the Governor-General signs the Bill, it
                    becomes a law. This is called Royal Assent.
                </div>
                <p>State and territory parliaments make their own
                    laws in a similar way</p>
