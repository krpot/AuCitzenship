                <h3>Important days for Australians</h3>
                <h4>Australia Day</h4>
                <p>
                On 26 January each year, we celebrate Australia Day. Australia Day is a public holiday in every state and territory in Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                On Australia Day, large and small communities across Australia celebrate all that is great about Australia and being Australian. It is the biggest annual public event in Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                Australia Day is the day that we honour our history and all the people who have made this nation great. It is a day to rejoice in the present and commit to a happy and prosperous future together. For this reason, it is a day when many citizenship ceremonies are held across the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is the anniversary of the arrival of the First Fleet from Great Britain in 1788 to set up a convict settlement for the British Government. The commander of the First Fleet was Captain Arthur Phillip.
                </p>
                <p>
                On the eve of Australia Day, the Prime Minister announces the Australian of the Year Awards in Canberra.
                </p>

                <h3>Anzac Day</h3>
                <p>
                Anzac Day is observed on 25 April each year. Anzac Day is named after the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, which landed at Gallipoli in Turkey during World War I on 25 April 1915.
                </p>

                <p>
                Anzac Day is a solemn day when we remember the sacrifice of all Australians who served and died in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations. We also honour the courage and commitment of all servicemen and women.
                </p>

                <p>
                More information about Australia Day, Anzac Day and other important national days and celebrations can be found in Part 4, Australia today.
