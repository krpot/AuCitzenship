                <p>At the citizenship ceremony, you pledge to uphold and obey the laws of Australia. It is important for you to understand Australiaâ€™s system of government, how the laws are made in our parliamentary democracy and how these laws are administered. It is also important to understand how you, as a citizen, will have a say in the running of the country. </p>
                
                <h3 id="s1">How do I have my say?</h3>
                <h4>Voting</h4>
                <p>In Australia, citizens aged 18 years or over must enrol to vote at federal elections. By voting, you get to have your say in who represents you in parliament. If you are not correctly enrolled, you are not able to vote in an election. </p>
                <p>Once you are on the electoral roll, voting is compulsory in Australian federal and state or territory elections. If you do not vote in an election and do not have a good reason for not voting, you will have to pay a fine. Compulsory voting is a way to make sure that the people we elect are really the ones that the majority of the people want. </p>
                <p>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is a Commonwealth agency. It conducts federal elections and referendums and maintains the Commonwealth electoral roll. The AEC helps to provide voters with fair and honest elections. The AEC is independent of the government. Political parties or people in government cannot influence the decisions of the AEC. Votes are
by secret ballot, so you are free and safe to vote for any candidate. No one else sees who you vote for. You can tell other people who you vote for, but no one can force you to tell them. </p>

                <h4>Raising matters with your representatives</h4>
                <p>In Australia, you have the right to raise matters that concern you with your elected representative. Your views may then be taken into consideration by parliament when it is considering new laws or changes to existing laws. For example, if you have a suggestion about how to improve the immigration system, you can make an appointment to discuss it with your local member of parliament. You can also write a letter outlining your views. </p>
                <p>In this way, ordinary Australians can have a say in forming the laws and policies of a government. </p>
