                <h3 id="section2">How did we establish our system of government?</h3>
                <h4>Federation</h4>
                <p>Before 1901, Australia was made up of six separate, self-governing British colonies.</p>
                <p>Within its borders, each colony had its own constitution and its own laws relating to defence, immigration, postage, trade and transport. </p>
                <p>People wanted to unite the colonies to form a single Australian nation for a number of reasons. Trade and transport between the colonies was expensive and slow. Enforcing the law across borders was difficult. The separate colonies also had weak systems of defence. More importantly, Australiaâ€™s national identity was beginning to form. Sporting teams were representing Australia internationally and a unique Australian culture was developing in popular songs, poems, stories and art. </p>
                <p>Uniting the nation was a difficult task, but over a period of time, the idea of one Australian nation became a reality. Australians are proud of the fact that their nation did not emerge through revolution or bloodshed, but by negotiation and referendum. </p>
                <p>On 1 January 1901, the colonies were united into a federation of states called the Commonwealth of Australia. </p>

                <h4>The Australian Constitution</h4>
                <p>The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 is the legal document that sets out the basic rules for the government of Australia. The Australian Constitution was originally passed as part of a British Act of Parliament in 1900. On 1 January 1901, when the Constitution took effect, the Australian colonies became one independent nation, the Commonwealth of Australia. </p>
                <p>The Australian Constitution established the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, created with a House of Representatives and a Senate. The Constitution also established the High Court of Australia, which has the power to apply and interpret the laws of Australia. </p>
                <p>The Australian Constitution can only be changed through a special vote called a referendum. </p>
                <p>In a referendum, there needs to be a double majority for the Australian Constitution to be changed. This means that the majority of voters in a majority of states and a majority of voters across the nation must vote for the change. </p>
