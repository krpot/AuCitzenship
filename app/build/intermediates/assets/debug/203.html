                <h4>Equality in Australia</h4>
                <p>There are a number of laws in Australia that make sure a person is not treated differently to others because of their gender, race, disability or age. </p>

                <h4>Equality of men and women</h4>
                <p>Men and women have equal rights in Australia. It is against the law to discriminate against a person because of their gender. </p>
                <p>Both men and women have the right to make their own independent choices about personal matters such as marriage, and are protected by the law from intimidation or violence.</p>
                <p>Both men and women have equal access to education and employment. Both men and women can vote and stand for parliament. Both men and women can join the Australian Defence Force and the police. Men and women are treated equally in courts of law. </p>

                <h4>Equality of opportunity</h4>
                <p>Australians do not believe in class distinctions in our society. Instead, we believe in a fair society, where everyone deserves a ‘fair go’. This means that what someone achieves in life should be a result of their hard work and talents, rather than their wealth or background. For example, a person should get a job or a promotion on the basis of their skills, ability and experience, not because of their background. </p>
                <p>Australia has many stories of new migrants who have become leaders in business, the professions, the arts, public service and sport through their hard work and talents. </p>
