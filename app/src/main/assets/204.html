                <h4>Privileges – what Australia will give you</h4>

                <p>Both men and women have equal access to education and employment. Both men and women can vote and stand for parliament. Both men and women can join the Australian Defence Force and the police. Men and women are treated equally in courts of law. </p>
                <hr>
                
                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <h4>Obey the law</h4>
                <p>Our representatives in government make laws to maintain an orderly, free and safe society and to protect our rights. All Australians must obey the laws made by the Australian Parliament, state and territory parliaments, and local government. </p>
                <p>More information about some important laws in Australia can be found in Part 3, Government and the law in Australia. </p>
                <hr>
                
                <h4>Vote in federal and state or territory elections, and in a referendum</h4>
                <p>Voting is both an important right and responsibility for all Australian citizens. We vote for the people we want to represent us in parliament. By doing this, we all have our say in how the country is governed and contribute to the future of Australia.</p>
                <p>As a citizen, you will vote regularly in federal and state or territory elections. Occasionally, you will vote in a referendum, which is a vote to change the Australian Constitution. More information about the Australian Constitution can be found in Part 3, Government and the law in Australia.</p>
                <p>Australian citizens aged 18 years or over must register their name and address on the electoral roll. Once you are on the electoral roll, voting is compulsory for Australian citizens aged 18 years or over in federal and state or territory elections. </p>
                <p>Voting in local government elections is not compulsory in some states. </p>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Defend Australia should the need arise</h4>
                <p>While service in the Australian Defence Force is voluntary, should the need arise it is vital that all Australian citizens be committed to joining together to defend the nation and its way of life. </p>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Serve on a jury if called to do so </h4>
                <p>Jury service is a responsibility for Australian citizens aged 18 years or over. A jury is a group of ordinary Australian men and women who listen to the evidence in a court case and decide if a person is guilty or not guilty. </p>
                <p>Any Australian who is on the electoral roll may be called to serve on a jury.</p>
                <p>Jury service helps to make sure that the court system is open and fair. </p>

                <h3>Participating in Australian society</h3>
                <p>Australia encourages all citizens to participate in society. Citizens who participate in society contribute to Australia in many ways. You can join neighbourhood and local communities. You can volunteer to do social and community work. You can join an arts or cultural organisation. You can also actively participate in political life. </p>
                <p>Paying tax is another important way you directly contribute to the Australian community. Tax is paid out of the money you earn, whether it’s from a job, a business or investments. </p>
                <p>Many of the benefits that Australians enjoy are made possible through taxes. Taxes are spent on services which include health, education, defence, roads and railways, and social security. By working and paying taxes, you can support the government to provide these important services to the Australian community. These services help make Australia the peaceful and prosperous country it is today. State and territory governments and local councils also collect taxes to pay for services. </p>
                <p>Paying tax is required by law. Tax is collected by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) from both businesses and individuals. The ATO works to ensure all citizens are aware of their tax rights and obligations to pay the correct amount of tax. </p>
