                <h3 id="p0">Our freedoms</h3>
                <h4>Freedom of speech and freedom of expression </h4>
                <p>Freedom of speech allows people to say and write what they think and to discuss their ideas with others. Freedom of expression allows people to express their views through art, film, music and literature.</p>
                <p>In Australia, we are free to say and write what we think, privately or publicly, about any topic. However, we cannot harm others. </p>
                <p>We cannot make false allegations, encourage others to break the law or damage another person’s reputation. There are laws to protect a person’s good name against false information. </p>
                <p>It is against the law to try to make other people hate or act violently towards others because of their culture, ethnicity or background. </p>
                <p>We are free to meet with people in public or private places for social or political discussion. We can criticise the government, peacefully protest against government decisions and campaign to change laws. </p>
                <p>We must also respect other people’s freedom of speech and freedom of expression</p>
                <p>Newspapers, television and radio have the same freedom.</p>

                <h4>Freedom of association</h4>
                <p>Australians are free to join any legal organisation, such as a political party, trade union, religious, cultural or social group. People can also decide not to join. </p>
                <p>Australians can gather with others to protest against a government action or an organisation. However, all protests must be within the law. This means they must be peaceful, and must not injure any person or damage property. </p>
                <hr>
                
                <h4>Freedom of religion and secular government </h4>
                <p>Australia has a Judaeo-Christian heritage, and many Australians describe themselves as Christians. Australia has public holidays on Christian days such as Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Christmas Day. </p>
                <p>However, the government in Australia is secular. This means that there is no official national religion. </p>
                <p>People in Australia are free to follow any religion they choose, as long as its practices do not break Australian laws. In addition to Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism and many other religions are practised freely in Australia. </p>
                <p>Australians are also free to not follow a religion. The government treats all citizens equally, whatever their religion or beliefs. </p>
                <p>This mix of religions contributes to making Australia a
vibrant multicultural society. </p>
                <p>Most religions have rules, but these are not laws in Australia. For example, the process of divorce, including custody of children and property settlement, must follow laws passed by the Australian Parliament. All Australians have the right to be protected by these laws. Some religious or cultural practices, such as being married to more than one person at the same time, are against Australian law. </p>
