                <p>At the citizenship ceremony, you pledge your loyalty to Australia and its people. It is therefore important for you to have an understanding of Australia’s community and population, including our Indigenous heritage. It
                is also important for you to understand how Australia developed from its uncertain beginnings as a British colony to the stable and successful multicultural nation it is today.</p>
                <p>In this section, you will read about some of the
                events that have contributed to our story. There is information about our states and territories, and there is information on the traditions and symbols that we proudly identify as being distinctly Australian.</p>

                <h3>Our people</h3>
                <h4 id="p1">Indigenous Australians</h4>
                <p>Australia&rsquo;s first inhabitants were the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They are the Indigenous people of Australia. Australia’s Indigenous cultures are the oldest continuing cultures in the world.</p>
                <p>Historically, Aboriginal people are from mainland Australia and Tasmania. They have lived here for between 40 000 and 60 000 years.</p>
                <p>Torres Strait Islanders are from islands to the north of Queensland. They have a distinct cultural identity.</p>
                <p>Indigenous people share common beliefs and traditions that still guide them today. They have a deep connection with the land that is expressed in their stories, art and dance.</p>

                <h4 id="p2">Early days of European settlement</h4>
                <p>European settlement started when the first 11 convict ships, which became known as the &rsquo;First Fleet&rsquo;, arrived from Great Britain on 26 January 1788.</p>
                <p>At this time British laws were harsh and the jails could not hold the large number of people imprisoned
                for their crimes. To manage this problem, the British Government decided to transport these convicts to the other side of the world; to the new colony of New South Wales.</p>
                <p>The first governor of the colony of New South Wales was Captain Arthur Phillip. He overcame many problems in the first few years of European settlement. The colony survived and as more convicts and free settlers arrived, it grew and developed. More colonies were established in other parts of the country.</p>
                <p>Early free settlers were from Great Britain and Ireland. This British and Irish heritage has had a major influence on Australia&rsquo;s history, culture and political institutions.</p>
                <p>In 1851, gold was discovered in the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria. People from all around the world came to these colonies to try their luck at making a fortune. Chinese people arriving at this time were the first large group of migrants not from Europe. In 10 years, the population more than doubled.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4 id="p3">The nation of Australia</h4>
                <p>Over the following decades, the separate colonies discussed the idea of becoming one nation.</p>
                <p>In 1901, the colonies were united into a federation
                of states called the Commonwealth of Australia. At that time, Australia&rsquo;s population was counted at about four million people. This number did not include the Indigenous people.</p>
                <p>Throughout the first half of the 20th century, migration levels rose and fell. There were programs to actively encourage British migrants to settle here, and many did.</p>
                <p>A wave of non-British migration came after
                World War II, when millions of people in Europe had to leave their homelands. Large numbers came to Australia to build a new life.</p>
                <p>In recent years, our migration and refugee programs have brought people to Australia from all over the world. People have come here to join family, to make a new life in a young country, or to escape poverty, war or persecution.</p>
                <p>Today, Australia has a population of about 22 million people. Over one quarter of these people were
                born overseas. Australia is greatly enriched by the contribution these people make to our nation. While we celebrate the diversity of Australia&rsquo;s people, we also aim to build a cohesive and unified nation.</p>
                <p>Australia&rsquo;s national language is English. It is part of our national identity. Everyone in Australia is encouraged to learn and use English to help them participate in Australian society. Communicating in English is also important for making the most of living and working in Australia. Other languages are also valued. In Australia&rsquo;s diverse society, over 200 languages are spoken.</p>
