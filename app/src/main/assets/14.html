                <h2>Part4 &ndash; Australia's flags</h2>

                <p>
                The Australian National Flag is the official flag of our nation. Other flags that are officially recognised and may be flown in the community include the Australian Aboriginal Flag and the Torres Strait Islander Flag.
                </p>

                <h4>The Australian National Flag</h4>
                The Australian National Flag is blue, white and red. It has three important parts:
                <ul>
                  <li>The flag of Great Britain, known as the Union Jack, is in the top left corner. The flag represents our history of British settlement.</li>
                  <li>The Commonwealth Star is under the Union Jack. This star has seven points, one point for each of the six states and one for the territories.</li>
                  <li>The Southern Cross, on the right, is a group of stars we see in the southern sky.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>The Australian Aboriginal Flag</h4>
                The Australian Aboriginal Flag is black, red and yellow. It has three important parts, and the most common interpretation of the colours is:
                <ul>
                    <li>The top half is black and represents the Aboriginal people of Australia.</li>
                    <li>The bottom half is red and represents the earth and a spiritual relation to the land.</li>
                    <li>The yellow circle represents the sun.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>The Torres Strait Islander Flag</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The green stripes represent the land.</li>
                    <li>The blue panel in the centre represents the sea.</li>
                    <li>The black lines represent the Torres Strait Islander people.</li>
                    <li>The white dancer&rsquo;s headdress in the centre is a symbol for all Torres Strait Islanders.</li>
                    <li>The points of the white star represent the island groups in the Torres Strait.</li>
                    <li>The colour white is a symbol of peace.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Commonwealth Coat of Arms</h3>
                The Commonwealth Coat of Arms is the official symbol of the Commonwealth of Australia. It represents our national unity. It identifies the authority and property of the Commonwealth of Australia.
                <ul>
                    <li>The shield in the centre represents the six states and federation.</li>
                    <li>A kangaroo and an emu support the shield on each side. Kangaroos are native Australian animals and emus are native Australian birds.</li>
                    <li>A gold Commonwealth Star sits above the shield.</li>
                    <li>The background is the golden wattle, Australia&rsquo;s national flower.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Australia&rsquo;s national flower</h3>
                Australia&rsquo;s national flower is the golden wattle. This small tree grows mainly in south-eastern Australia.
            It has bright green leaves and many golden yellow flowers in spring. Each of the states and territories of Australia also has its own floral emblem.

                <h3>Australia&rsquo;s national colours</h3>
            Australia&rsquo;s national colours are green and gold, the colours of the golden wattle. The uniforms of our national sports teams are usually green and gold.

                <h3>Australia&rsquo;s national gemstone</h3>
            The opal is Australia&rsquo;s national gemstone. In Aboriginal legend, a rainbow touched the earth and created the colours of the opal.
