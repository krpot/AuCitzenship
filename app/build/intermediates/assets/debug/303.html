                <h3>How is the power of government controlled?</h3>
                <p>The Australian Constitution divides power between three arms of government. This is to stop one person or one group of people taking over all the power to govern Australia. </p>

                <h5>Legislative power</h5>
                <p>
                    Parliament has the power to make and change the laws. Parliament is made up of representatives who are elected by the people of Australia.
                </p>


                <h5>Executive power</h5>
                <p>
                    Executive power is the power to put the laws into practice. The Executive includes Australian Government ministers and the Governor-General. Each minister is responsible for one or more government departments.
                </p>


                <h5>Judicial power</h5>
                <p>
                    Judges have the power to interpret and apply the law. Courts and judges are independent of parliament and government.
                </p>

                <p>These powers are written into the Australian Constitution. </p>
