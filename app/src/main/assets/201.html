                <p>At the citizenship ceremony, you pledge that you share Australia’s democratic beliefs and that you respect the rights and liberties of the people of Australia.</p>
                <p>Australia is a democracy. A democracy is a system of government in which citizens freely choose representatives to govern the country and make laws on their behalf.</p>
                <p>Australians believe in peace, respect, freedom and equality. An important part of being Australian is respecting other people’s differences and choices, even if you don’t agree with those choices. It is about treating people fairly and giving all Australians equal opportunities and freedoms, no matter where they come from, what their traditions are, or whether they are male or female.</p>
                <p>These democratic beliefs have shaped our country and culture and are a reason why so many people want to become Australian. It is therefore very important that you understand these democratic beliefs, and the rights and liberties that all Australian people respect.</p>
                
                <h3>Our democratic beliefs</h3>
                <h4 id="p1">Parliamentary democracy</h4>
                <p>Australia’s system of government is a parliamentary democracy. This means that all Australians are involved in how the country is governed. The power of the government comes from the Australian people because Australian citizens regularly vote for people to represent them in parliament. Only parliament has the power to make and change the laws that govern the country.</p>
                <p>In a parliamentary democracy, the representatives in parliament must answer to the people, through elections, for the decisions they make. </p>

                <h4 id="p2">The rule of law</h4>
                <p>Australia’s laws are important for all people living in Australia. Australians recognise the value of laws in maintaining a peaceful and orderly society. All Australians have the right to be protected by Australia’s laws.</p>
                <p>Everyone must obey Australia’s laws. If they don’t obey the law, they may be arrested by the police and have to go to court.</p>
                <p>All Australians are equal under the law and no person or group is above the law. This is called the ‘rule of law’. People who hold positions of power in the Australian community must obey Australia’s laws. This includes government, community and religious leaders, as well as businesspeople and the police.</p>        

                <h4 id="p3">Living peacefully</h4>
                <p>We are proud to live in a peaceful country with a stable system of government. We believe that change should occur through discussion, peaceful persuasion and the democratic process. We reject violence as a way to change a person’s mind or the law. </p>
                
                <h4 id="p4">Respect for all individuals regardless of background</h4>
                <p>People come to settle in Australia from countries all around the world. Many people have a different cultural heritage with different beliefs and traditions. In our democratic society, we are all free to follow and share these beliefs and traditions as long as they do not break Australian laws.</p>
                <p>We value this freedom and expect all Australians to treat each other with dignity and respect, regardless of their race, country of origin, gender, sexual preference, marital status, age, disability, heritage, culture, politics, wealth or religion. </p>
                
                <h4>Compassion for those in need</h4>
                <p>In Australia, there is a spirit of ‘mateship’. This means we help and receive help from each other in times of need. A mate is often a friend, but can also be a total stranger. A mate might take a meal to an elderly neighbour, drive a friend to a medical appointment or visit someone who is lonely. </p>
                <p>Because of this spirit of mateship, many individual people and groups help others through voluntary community work. You can also be a volunteer. Volunteering can be very satisfying. It is also a great opportunity to share knowledge, learn new skills, and increase your sense of belonging to the Australian community. Our government also supports Australians
in need through social security and other services.</p>
